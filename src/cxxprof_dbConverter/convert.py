'''
This script simply loads the SQLite DBs created by cxxprof_server and converts them to a JSON format which
Chromiums tracing-view could understand and display.

There are some issues where the activities are not fully compatible with the format of the needed JSON, but
for simplicities sake and better performance this is hacked to work in a useful way.

Usage:
    If the script is called with db-files as arguments it will convert these, else if will simply convert
    everything it finds in the current working directory
